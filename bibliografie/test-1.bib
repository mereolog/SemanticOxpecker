abstract = "Longissimus lumborum et thoracis muscles from 150 cattle comprising Czech Pied breed bulls and cows were used to investigate the relationship between pH value and beef tenderness as influenced by housing before slaughter and by the hanging mode of carcasses. The pH value was measured in the loin at the end of the slaughter-line (pH0) and after cooling of carcasses (pH24,&#xa0;pH48). The texture of raw meat was measured 72&#xa0;h post-mortem by the Warner–Bratzler shear method; the shear force was related to pH. Curvilinear relationships with coefficients of correlation r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.64 (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05) for bulls individually housed and r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.83 for bulls housed in groups between the shear force and the pH value 24&#xa0;h p.m. were found with maximal shear force (the most tough meat) in the range of pH24 from 6.2 to 6.4. Lower correlations (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.72 and r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.54) between pH24 and meat tenderness were found in the case of cows individually housed and housed in groups, respectively. No significant relationships were found between texture and pH measured at the end of the slaughter-line (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.59 for bulls and r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.65 for cows) and 48&#xa0;h post-mortem (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.64 for bulls and r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.50 for cows). The mode of housing of cattle before slaughter influenced the properties of beef significantly. Meat of bulls housed in groups before slaughter was less tender (the shear force was higher) than meat of bulls individually housed. It could be explained by higher depletion of glycogen before slaughter and thus insufficient pH decline. Generally, the meat of cows was more tender than of bulls irrespective of housing. No significant differences were found between the left and right halves of carcasses. Thus the mode of hanging had no influence on beef tenderness."

abstract = "The objective of this study was to evaluate the importance of proteolysis and sarcomere length in determining the tenderness of bovine M. longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle over a 21-day period. This was done by altering the pre-rigor glycolytic behaviour of hot-boned LD muscles using different early post-mortem temperature regimes. Hot-boned LD muscles (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8) were cut in two, randomised, placed in polythene bags and submerged in a water bath set at 5&#xa0;°C (rapidly chilled) and 15&#xa0;°C (slowly chilled) for 8&#xa0;h post-mortem. All muscles were then stored at 2&#xa0;°C for up to 21 days post-mortem. The temperature regimes altered the glycolytic behaviour of the muscles in the pre-rigor period. The slowly chilled muscles exhibited a faster (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01) pH fall than rapidly chilled muscles. Cold shortening was induced in rapidly chilled muscles as they had shorter (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01) sarcomere lengths than slowly chilled muscles up to day 21 post-mortem. Warner Bratzler shear force values (WBSF) deemed cold-shortened muscles as tougher than noncold shortened up to day 14 post-mortem. Both cold-shortened and noncold-shortened muscles tenderised over time to an extent where there was no significant difference in WBSF values by day 21 post-mortem. SDS–PAGE protein profiles indicated that the rate of proteolysis was faster in slowly chilled muscles when compared to rapidly chilled muscles. However by day 21 post-mortem it appeared that rapidly and slowly chilled muscles underwent proteolysis to the same extent."

abstract = "The aim of this study was to determine consumer ability to discern different levels of beef tenderness established by Warner–Bratzler shear (WBs). A panel of 220 people evaluated 60 samples of longissimus thoracis using a 5-point intensity scale (1: very tough; 5: very tender). Samples differed for commercial category, breed of animals and ageing length of meat. Shear force was measured by Instron equipped with a Warner–Bratzler device on 1.27&#xa0;cm diameter cores.

Correlation coefficient of WBs measurements with tenderness sensory ratings was −0.72. WBs value corresponding to class 3 of the sensory tenderness was 47.77&#xa0;N. From this value, the range of WBs (22.96–72.59&#xa0;N) was split into five categories to which connect the five classes of sensory tenderness. The results suggest consumers’ difficulty in discriminating category 1 (WBs&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;62.59&#xa0;N) from category 2 (WBs: 52.78–62.59&#xa0;N) and a greater inclination to distinguish category 5 (WBs&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;32.96&#xa0;N). As WBs category boundaries were probably too restrictive for the panel’s selective ability, WBs scale was reduced to 3 categories by joining the two extreme categories (i.e. category 2 with 1 and category 4 with 5). In this case, 55.6% of consumers significantly discriminated tough from intermediate and tender meat and 62.3% distinguished tender from intermediate and tough meat (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01). Hence, WBs values &gt;52.68&#xa0;N and &lt;42.87&#xa0;N allow classification of tough and tender beef in a sufficiently reliable way."

In this study, it was observed that more information on beef tenderness is obtained with colour measurements taken on the carcass LTD and RA, and LD at 24&#xa0;h post-mortem. However, the regression analysis showed that beef TI from Pireanica young bulls can be predicted quite accurately by C∗ measured on the RA muscle just 45&#xa0;min after slaughter."

abstract = "One of the major changes in connective tissues during heating is the transformation of the quasi-crystalline structure of collagen into a random-like structure. This molecular change induces a shortening of these tissues and gives them a rubber-like behaviour. In this state, their mechanical properties are dependent on the total number of cross-linked chains present per volume, which can be estimated from the number and the functionality of each cross-link present in the sample. The number of cross-linked chains per volume of meat explains a large amount of the tenderness variation, produced by muscle type, animal age, type, and sex in different species. During heating collagen fibres and fibrils shortening produces a pressure which is also dependent on the total amount of cross-linked chains present per volume, but also on the morphology of endomysial and perimysial envelopes. In meat, during heating, collagen fibres and fibrils thermal shortening is restricted by muscle fibres and muscle fibre bundles. This restriction, which depends on several muscle fibre characteristics, has a strong effect on the final elastic modulus of connective tissues, by changing the respective amount of crystalline and rubber-like fractions in collagen fibres and fibrils after heating. The implications of this phenomenon in tenderness variations are discussed."
